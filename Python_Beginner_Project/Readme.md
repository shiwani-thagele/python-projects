## 📌 About Project  
This is a **menu-driven calculator** built using Python.  
It allows users to perform **basic arithmetic operations** such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
The program keeps running until the user chooses to exit.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ Perform **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division**  
✔️ Handles **Division by Zero** error gracefully  
✔️ **Menu-driven interface** (easy to use)  
✔️ Runs in a **loop** until user exits  

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Covered  
- Input & Output (`input()`, `print()`)  
- Data Types & Type Casting (`float()`)  
- Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)  
- Conditional Statements (`if-elif-else`)  
- Functions (`def`)  
- Loops (`while True`)  
- Error Handling (`try-except`)  

---

## 📖 How It Works  
1️⃣ User selects an operation from the menu  
2️⃣ Program asks for two numbers  
3️⃣ Calculator performs the operation and displays the result  
4️⃣ The menu reappears until the user selects "Exit"

## 💻 Example Run  

---- Calculator Menu ----

Add

Subtract

Multiply

Divide

Exit
Enter choice: 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15.0

## 🧑‍💻 Learning Outcomes  
By building this project, I learned:  
- Designing **menu-driven applications**  
- Writing **modular code** using functions  
- Handling **invalid inputs & runtime errors**  
- Using **loops** to keep programs interactive  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements  
- ➕ Add **scientific operations** (power, square root, factorial, etc.)  
- 🖥️ Build a **GUI version** using Tkinter/PyQt  
- 📜 Add **history of operations** feature
